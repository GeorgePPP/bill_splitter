## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Windows Development Environment**
- **Conda** (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **Azure Document Intelligence** account
- **OpenAI API** account

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. **Setup Environment** (one-time setup):
   ```cmd
   set-up-windows.cmd
   ```
   This script will:
   - Create a conda environment with Python 3.11
   - Install all Python dependencies
   - Install all Node.js dependencies
   - Verify all prerequisites

2. **Start Development Servers**:
   ```cmd
   start-windows.cmd
   ```
   This script will:
   - Start the backend server on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Start the frontend server on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Open both in separate terminal windows

3. **Configure API Keys**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
   ```env
   OCR_KEY=your_azure_ocr_key_here
   OCR_ENDPOINT=your_azure_ocr_endpoint_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`
   - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup or are not using Windows, follow these steps:

#### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n bill-splitter python=3.11
   conda activate bill-splitter
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select People**: Choose how many people are splitting the bill
2. **Enter Names**: Add names and contact info for each participant
3. **Upload Receipt**: Take a photo or upload an image of your receipt
4. **Assign Items**: Assign each item to the person who ordered it
5. **View Results**: See the final split with tax and tip calculations
